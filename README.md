# OpenGML
## OpenGML - Open Geometric Music Language

A language for creating nested geometries based on Geometric Musical Language (GML). GML is a language developed originally to describe
the complex resonances within Microtubules occurring in the form of "Triplet of Triplet" resonance bands. GML also provides
the foundations for constructing simulations of "Polyatomic Time Crystals" using 3D Bloch Spheres and for simulating
"Self Operating Mathematical Universes" (SOMU).

OpenGML provides two interchangeable frameworks using Kivy for 2D OpenGML and Pygame with OpenGL for 3D OpenGML.
Both frameworks support the addition of sonification using FluidSynth and GM SoundFonts (.sf2) to create stereo panned
soundscapes using atonal frequencies based on the geometry of the OpenGML structures modelled.
